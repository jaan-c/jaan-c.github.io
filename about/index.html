    <p>I&rsquo;m Jaan, a self taught programmer. At the moment I&rsquo;m trying to get into app development by learning native Android. After years of aimlessly learning random programming languages for fun, now I&rsquo;m trying to commit to one and make useful programs.</p>
<p>I started coding after graduating high school, after I got curious about Linux from the show Mr. Robot. The first months, I&rsquo;ve probably distro-hopped more than my fingers could count, using my neighbor&rsquo;s WiFi to download ISOs (sorry!), trying to find the best one and ended up settling with where I started anyway, Ubuntu, because it&rsquo;s the easiest to install. Right now I&rsquo;m a happy user of KDE Neon.</p>
<p>This is my blog. For now I don&rsquo;t have any specific topics I&rsquo;m planning to write about and I&rsquo;ve mainly created a blog for three reasons. The first one is that I wanted to take on the 100 Days to Offload challenge I keep reading about in Mastodon, the second is that I&rsquo;m in desperate need of another hobby besides coding. And the third is to incentivize myself to learn more and have something interesting to share about.</p>
<p>Toot me at <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@bredlof">@bredlof</a> if you have anything to share!</p>
