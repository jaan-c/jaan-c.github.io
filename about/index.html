At the moment I&rsquo;m trying to get into app development by learning native Android and from time to time I code in Rust.</p><p>I got into coding after I got curious about Linux from the show Mr. Robot 6 years ago. The first months, I&rsquo;ve probably distro-hopped more than my fingers could count. At the moment I&rsquo;m a happy user of KDE Neon.</p><p>This is my blog. For now I don&rsquo;t have any specific topics I&rsquo;m planning to write about and I&rsquo;ve mainly created a blog for three reasons. The first one is that I wanted to take on the 100 Days to Offload challenge I keep reading in <a href=https://fosstodon.org>Fosstodon</a>, the second is that I&rsquo;m in desperate need of another hobby besides coding. And the third is to incentivize myself to learn more and have something interesting to share.</p><p>Toot me at <a href=https://fosstodon.org/@bredlof>@bredlof</a> if you have anything to share!</p></main><footer><h5>A very Jaan blog.</h5><h5><a href=https://github.com/jaan-c>github.com/jaan-c</a></h5></footer></body></html>
