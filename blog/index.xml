Complexity is when something is made up of many entities and have innumerable interactions between each other, to such a degree that it is difficult to keep track of them consciously at once.
Simplicity is complexity organized and extraneous things omitted, which makes the navigability of entities and interactions a lot easier.
Abstraction is hiding complexity, and only showing what is relevant to a certain use case or situation at the cost of losing capability.</description></item><item><title>SSDs Go Brrr</title><link>http://jaan-c.github.io/blog/ssds-go-brrr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 22:26:07 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://jaan-c.github.io/blog/ssds-go-brrr/</guid><description>Most of my experience with computers involve passed down laptops or unused computers at home. I&amp;rsquo;ve always assumed that they&amp;rsquo;re just painfully slow because of the CPU and stuck with it. Since I only code on the desktop and watch some videos from time to time, it never bothered me.
Up until I got into Android development (with Kotlin) again, after getting tired of Flutter&amp;rsquo;s limitations, that&amp;rsquo;s when I notice how much of a bottleneck the hard drive speed is.</description></item></channel></rss>
