Complexity is when something is made up of many entities and have innumerable interactions between each other, to such a degree that it is difficult to keep track of them consciously at once.
Simplicity is complexity organized and extraneous things omitted, which makes the navigability of entities and interactions a lot easier.
Abstraction is hiding complexity, and only showing what is relevant to a certain use case or situation at the cost of losing capability.</description></item></channel></rss>
